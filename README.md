Dynamically loading local and external components into AngularJS

[angular-widget](https://github.com/wix/angular-widget) makes it possible to dynamically load views with associated
angular modules, controllers, css and html to the main application. This sample shows how to load both route based 
dynamic components and widget based components. It also shows that it's possible to load such component from another
website making it possible to package the UI of some service to be distributed with that service and loadable during
runtime to the main application.
